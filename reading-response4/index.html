        <ul>
          <li> I was very confused when I opened this site, I thought I opened a wrong website. Keep looking at this, it made me anxious and uncomfortable.
          </li>
          <li>I think this website has captured the today’s social media very well. That people including most of us, are constantly waiting for the response and attention.
          </li>
          <li>I chat with many people using many social media, when I open the folder and see texts that I received, I sometimes feel uncomfortable and worried. This website encapsulated this idea in direct way.
          </li>
          <li>Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett’ noted “The words on the screen neither precede nor follow speech, though they often feel more like talking than writing…”: online chatting is semi-immediate form of talking that we can revised until it sent. I feel that we can hide our feelings behind the text and act differently.
          </li>
          <li>
          “Many users will not wait more than a few seconds for content to load online. Anything longer than this breeds great frustration.”
          </li>
          <ol>I agree with the example that if a friend may be texting on a train and suddenly rushes into a tunnel and loose the connection, then we will be left unhappily.
            </ol>
          <ol>I usually gets very frustrated when the website does not open quick enough. I often then close the tab and search for new website or keep clicking the refresh button.
            </ol>
          <li>“Both social and news media seek to appeal to and produce a sense that something important is just about to happen.”
          </li>
          <ol> I agree that the media keep us alarmed and curious to click in more.
            </ol>
          <li>“As the size of group chats increases, the relevance of each utterance to the individual often reduces and the stream of notifications for each trivial comment increases”
          </li>
          <ol>I have many group chats that has 3 people to around 900 people. No matter which group chat I am in, I sometimes feel very anxious to speak up and follow the conversation.
            </ol>
          <li>“Multitasking has been found to increase the production of the stress hormone cortisol” as well as “the fight-or-flight hormone adrenaline.
          </li>
          <ol>Most of the time, I can’t focus on just doing one thing. I often instantly texting and looking at social media while I am studying or hanging out with my friends.
            </ol>
