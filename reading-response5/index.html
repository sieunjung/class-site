      <p><strong> Net Art Anthology ‘Starrynight’ (1999) </strong> <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex Galloway, Mark Tribe and Martin Wattenberg

        <ul>
          <li>“Net Art Anthology aims to address the shortage of historical perspectives on a field in which even the most prominent artworks are often inaccessible.”  </li>
            <ol>How other old artworks, including paintings, architecture, sculptures and more have survived and preserved until now. There were efforts of the art conservators who tried to protect the artwork from weather, time and other environmental factors. </ol>
            <ol>The web pages or networks has changed overtime and the software that is changed as well. It is important to preserve and provide people opportunities to see and experience the important network artwork. </ol>
          <li>StarryNight is an artistic interface for the curated, online archive of Rhizome’s email discussion lists. Each mail in the archive was represented by a glowing point of light against dark background. </li>
          <li>The users could navigate and draw constellations connecting related emails with the assigned keywords. </li>
          <li>I enjoyed when access an email on archive, a dot would appear on the black background, and it grows brighter. It was very beautiful and interactive while I was looking at it. </li>
          <li>The glowing aspect looked like an animation and very special but I thought it may distract from reading the actual text. </li>
          <li>I enjoyed to look at the difference qualities and designs that this website hold compare to now. I value the texture that is creates from the pixelated web. </li>
          <li>Website include all the descriptions and videos of the website, also explanation how they tried to preserve the website. It was very helpful throughout. </li>
