      <h1>Death Is Nothing At All</h1>
        <p><em>Death</em> is <strong>nothing</strong> at all.</p>
        <p>It does not count.</p>
        <p>I have only slipped away into the next room.</p>
        <p><strong>Nothing</strong> has happened.</p><br>

        <p>Everything remains exactly as it was.</p>
        <p>I am I, and you are you,</p>
        <p>and the old life that we lived so fondly together is untouched, unchanged.</p>
        <p>Whatever we were to each other, that we are <small>still.</small></p><br>

        <p>Call me by the old familiar name.</p>
        <p>Speak of me in the easy way which you always used.</p>
        <p>Put no difference into your tone.</p>
        <p>Wear no forced air of <small>solemnity or sorrow.<small></p><br>

        <p>Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes that we enjoyed together.</p>
        <p><big>Play, smile, think<big> of me, pray for me.</p>
        <p>Let my name be ever the household word that it always was.</p>
        <p>Let it be spoken without an effort, without the ghost of a shadow upon it.</p><br>

        <p><em>Life means all that it ever meant.</em></p>
        <p>It is the same as it ever was.</p>
        <p>There is absolute and unbroken continuity.</p>
        <p>What is this <em>death</em> but a negligible accident?</p><br>

        <p>Why should I be out of mind because I am out of sight?</p>
        <p>I am but waiting for you, for an interval,</p>
        <p>somewhere very near,</p>
        <p>just round the corner.</p><br>

        <p>All is well.</p>
        <p><strong>Nothing</strong> is hurt; nothing is lost.</p>
        <p>One brief moment and all will be as it was before.</p>
        <p>How we shall laugh at the trouble of parting <em>when we meet again!</em></p><br>
