      <p>Death Is Nothing At All<br><br><br>
        by Henry Scott-Holland<br><br><br>
        Death is nothing at all.<br><br>
        It does not count. <br><br>
        I have only slipped away into the next room. <br><br>
        Nothing has happened. <br><br><br>
        Everything remains exactly as it was. <br><br>
        I am I, and you are you, <br><br>
        and the old life that we lived so fondly together is untouched, unchanged. <br><br>
        Whatever we were to each other, that we are still. <br><br><br>
        Call me by the old familiar name. <br><br>
        Speak of me in the easy way which you always used. <br><br>
        Put no difference into your tone. <br><br>
        Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow. <br><br><br>
        Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes that we enjoyed together.<br><br>
        Play, smile, think of me, pray for me. <br><br>
        Let my name be ever the household word that it always was. <br><br>
        Let it be spoken without an effort, without the ghost of a shadow upon it. <br><br><br>
        Life means all that it ever meant. <br><br>
        It is the same as it ever was. <br><br>
        There is absolute and unbroken continuity. <br><br>
        What is this death but a negligible accident? <br><br><br>
        Why should I be out of mind because I am out of sight? <br><br>
        I am but waiting for you, for an interval, <br><br>
        somewhere very near, <br><br>
        just round the corner. <br><br><br>
        All is well. <br><br>
        Nothing is hurt; nothing is lost. <br><br>
        One brief moment and all will be as it was before. <br><br>
        How we shall laugh at the trouble of parting when we meet again!<br><br>
