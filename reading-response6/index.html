          <li> “not everyone on the web is looking for practical information. Some look to remove the forks from the dinner table and set it into a frame of their own devising.”
          </li>
            <ol>There are many usages of the web, sometimes it could be a shopping mall, or just hovering to relax.
          </ol>
            <ol>I sometimes feel lost on the website; I lose track of what I was searching for because of those hyperlinks from the article, Google, and other pages. </ol>
          <li>“Surfing is being led by the wave as you make your choices. The wave stirs up gifts….on spirit surfers this gift is referred to as a boon. The boon is revealed at the eureka moment of a surf when the surfer becomes enlightened by the INFOspirit.
          </li>
          <li>“perhaps finding is making, but the finding is not enough.” </li>
          <ol>It is essential to show and describe the beauty of jewels and rewards.
            </ol>
          <ol>We should strengthen the criteria by experiencing many boons on the forum as Sprit Surfer and see the new beauty on the web.
            </ol>
          <ol> Joseph Cornell found a playing card and a toy bird in an empty lot and arranged items inside a box. INFOmonk found a .gif and .midi file on real estate website and framed them in HTML table = brilliant idea forming and inspiration, which led further studies
            </ol>
          <li>INFObrasts produce physical masterpieces; they maven use Google to search h for physical masterpieces
          </li>
          <li>INFOmonk they value the real masterpieces, but they reveal to us an art that is unreachable but right at our fingertips. .
