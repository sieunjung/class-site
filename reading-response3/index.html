      <h1> A Rant on Technology </h1>
      <h2> Ursula K.Le Guin </h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Technology is the active human interface with the material world. </li>
          <li>“Technology" and "hi tech" are not synonymous, and a technology that isn't "hi," isn't necessarily "low" in any meaningful sense.”</li>
          <li>One way to illustrate that most technologies are, in fact, pretty "hi," is to ask yourself of any manmade object, Do I know how to make one?</li>
          <li>Some proper respect for "low" or "primitive" or "simple" technologies</li>
