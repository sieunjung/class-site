        <h1>Death Is Nothing At All</h1>
      <h2>by Henry Scott-Holland</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="verse">
      <p><strong>Death</strong> is nothing at all.<br>
        It does not count. <br>
        I have only slipped away into the next room. <br>
        <em>Nothing has happened.</em> <br><br>
        Everything remains exactly as it was. <br>
        I am I, and you are you, <br>
        and the old life that we lived so fondly together is untouched, unchanged. <br>
        Whatever we were to each other, that we are <strong>still.</strong> <br><br>
        Call me by the old familiar name. <br>
        Speak of me in the easy way which you always used. <br>
        <em>Put no difference into your tone.</em> <br>
        Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow. <br><br>
        Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes that we enjoyed together.<br>
        <span style="font-weight:bolder"><span style="color:#ffb515;">Play,</span><span style="color:#ff5700;"> smile,</span><span style="color:#C21F40;"> think of me,</span><span style="color:pink;"> pray for me.</span> <br>
        Let my name be ever the household word that it always was. <br>
        Let it be spoken without an effort, without the ghost of a shadow upon it. <br><br>
        Life means all that it ever meant. <br>
        It is the same as it ever was. <br>
        There is absolute and unbroken continuity. <br>
        What is this <strong>death</strong> but a negligible accident? <br><br>
        Why should I be out of <big>mind</big> because I am out of <big>sight?</big> <br>
        I am but <strong>waiting</strong> for you, for an interval, <br>
        somewhere very near, <br>
        just round the corner. <br><br>
        All is well. <br>
        <em>Nothing is hurt; nothing is lost.</em> <br>
        One brief moment and all will be as it was before. <br>
        How we shall laugh at the trouble of parting when we meet again!<br>
      </p>
