      Death Is Nothing At All</p>
    </div>

    <p class="stanza1">
      <br> <strong>Death</strong> is nothing at all.<br>
      It does not count. <br>
      I have only slipped away into the next room. <br>
      Nothing has happened.
    </p>

    <p class="stanza2">
      <br>Everything remains exactly as it was. <br>
      I am I, and you are you, <br>
      and the old life that we lived so fondly together is untouched, unchanged. <br>
      Whatever we were to each other, that we are still.
    </p>

    <p class="stanza3">
      <br>  Call me by the old familiar name. <br>
        Speak of me in the easy way which you always used. <br>
        Put no difference into your tone.<br>
        Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow.
    </p>

    <p class="stanza4">
      <br>Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes that we enjoyed together.<br>
      Play,smile,think of me, pray for me.<br>
      Let my name be ever the household word that it always was. <br>
    </p>
    <p class="stanza5">
      <br>Life means all that it ever meant. <br>
      It is the same as it ever was. <br>
      There is absolute and unbroken continuity. <br>
      What is this death but a negligible accident? <br>
    </p>
    <p class="stanza6">
      <br>Why should I be out of mind because I am out of sight? <br>
      I am but waiting for you, for an interval, <br>
      somewhere very near, <br>
      just round the corner. <br>
    </p>
    <p class="stanza7">
      <br>All is well. <br>
      Nothing is hurt; nothing is lost.<br>
      One brief moment and all will be as it was before. <br>
      How we shall laugh at the trouble of parting when we meet again! <br>
    </p>
