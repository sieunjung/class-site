      Death Is Nothing At All by Henry Scott-Holland</div>

    <div class="sticky one">
        Death is nothing at all.
        </div>
        <div class="sticky one">
        It does not count.
        </div>
        <div class="sticky one">
        I have only slipped away into the next room.
        </div>
        <div class="sticky one">
        Nothing has happened.
      </div>

      <div class="sticky two">
       Everything remains exactly as it was.
       </div>
       <div class="sticky two">
        I am I, and you are you,
        </div>
        <div class="sticky two">
        and the old life that we lived so fondly together is untouched, unchanged.
        </div>
        <div class="sticky two">
        Whatever we were to each other, that we are still.
        </div>

      <div class="sticky three">
        Call me by the old familiar name.
        </div>
      <div class="sticky three">
        Speak of me in the easy way which you always used.
        </div>
        <div class="sticky three">
        Put no difference into your tone.
        </div>
        <div class="sticky three">
        Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow.
        </div>

      <div class="sticky four">
      Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes that we enjoyed together.
      </div>
      <div class="sticky four">
        Play, smile, think of me, pray for me.
        </div>
      <div class="sticky four">
        Let my name be ever the household word that it always was.
        </div>
      <div class="sticky four">
        Let it be spoken without an effort, without the ghost of a shadow upon it.
        </div>

      <div class="sticky five">
        Life means all that it ever meant.
      </div>
        <div class="sticky five">
        It is the same as it ever was.
        </div>
        <div class="sticky five">
        There is absolute and unbroken continuity.
        </div>
        <div class="sticky five">
        What is this death but a negligible accident?
        </div>

      <div class="sticky six">
      Why should I be out of mind because I am out of sight?
      </div>
        <div class="sticky six">
        I am but waiting for you, for an interval,
        </div>
        <div class="sticky six">
        somewhere very near,
        </div>
        <div class="sticky six">
        just round the corner.
      </div>

      <div class="sticky seven">
      All is well.
      </div>
      <div class="sticky seven">
        Nothing is hurt; nothing is lost.
        </div>
        <div class="sticky seven">
        One brief moment and all will be as it was before.
        </div>
        <div class="sticky seven">
        How we shall laugh at the trouble of parting when we meet again!
      </div>
