        <h1>Death Is Nothing At All</h1>
      <h2>by Henry Scott-Holland</h2>
      </div>
  </div>
      <div class="box">
        <div class="verse1">
         <p>Death is nothing at all.<br>
        It does not count. <br>
        I have only slipped away into the next room. <br>
        Nothing has happened.</p>
      </div>
      </div>
        <div class="verse2">
        <p>Everything remains exactly as it was. <br>
        I am I, and you are you, <br>
        and the old life that we lived so fondly together is untouched, unchanged. <br>
        Whatever we were to each other, that we are still.</p>
      </div>
        </div>
          <div class="verse3">
        <p>Call me by the old familiar name. <br>
        Speak of me in the easy way which you always used. <br>
        Put no difference into your tone.<br>
        Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow.</p>
        </div>
          <div class="verse4">
        <p>Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes that we enjoyed together.<br>
        Play,smile,think of me, pray for me.<br>
        Let my name be ever the household word that it always was. <br>
        </p>
          </div>
          <div class="verse5">
        <p>Life means all that it ever meant. <br>
        It is the same as it ever was. <br>
        There is absolute and unbroken continuity. <br>
        What is this death but a negligible accident? </p>
          </div>
          <div class="verse6">
        <p>Why should I be out of mind because I am out of sight? <br>
        I am but waiting for you, for an interval, <br>
        somewhere very near, <br>
        just round the corner.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="verse7">
        <p>All is well. <br>
        Nothing is hurt; nothing is lost.<br>
        One brief moment and all will be as it was before. <br>
        How we shall laugh at the trouble of parting when we meet again!<br>
      </p>
          </div>
