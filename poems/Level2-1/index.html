      <h1>Death Is Nothing At All</h1>
      <h2>by Henry Scott-Holland</h2>
      <p>
        Death is nothing at all.<br>
        It does not count. <br>
        <em>I have only slipped away into the next room.</em><br>
        <small>Nothing has happened.</small> <br><br>
        Everything remains exactly as it was. <br>
        <em>I am I, and you are you, <br>
        and the old life that we lived so fondly together is untouched, unchanged.</em> <br>
        Whatever we were to each other, that we are still. <br><br>
        Call me by the old familiar name. <br>
        Speak of me in the easy way which you always used. <br>
        Put no difference into your tone. <br>
        Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow. <br><br>
        Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes that we enjoyed together.<br>
        <big>Play, smile, think of me, pray for me.</big> <br>
        Let my name be ever the household word that it always was. <br>
        Let it be spoken without an effort, without the ghost of a shadow upon it. <br><br>
        Life means all that it ever meant. <br>
        It is the same as it ever was. <br>
        There is absolute and unbroken continuity. <br>
        <em>What is this death but a negligible accident?</em><br><br>
        <em>Why should I be out of mind because I am out of sight?</em><br>
        <em>I am but waiting for you, for an interval, <br>
        somewhere very near,</em> <br>
        just round the corner. <br><br>
        All is well. <br>
        Nothing is hurt; nothing is lost. <br>
        One brief moment and all will be as it was before. <br>
        <strong><big>How we shall laugh at the trouble of parting when we meet again!</big><br>
