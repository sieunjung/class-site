      <h1>Death Is Nothing At All</h1><br><br><br><br>
        <h2>Death is nothing at all.</h2><br>
        <h3>It does not count.</h3> <br>
        <h4>I have only slipped away into the next room.></h4><br>
        <h5>Nothing has happened.</h5><br><br><br><br>
        <h5>Everything remains exactly as it was.</h5><br>
        <h4>I am I, and you are you,</h4><br>
        <h3>and the old life that we lived so fondly together is untouched, unchanged.</h3><br>
        <h2>Whatever we were to each other, that we are still.</h2><br><br><br><br>
        <h2>Call me by the old familiar name.</h2> <br>
        <h3>Speak of me in the easy way which you always used.</h3><br>
        <h4>Put no difference into your tone.</h4><br>
        <h5>Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow.</h5><br><br><br><br>
        <h5>Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes that we enjoyed together.</h5><br>
        <h4>Play, smile, think of me, pray for me.</h4><br>
        <h3>Let my name be ever the household word that it always was.</h3><br>
        <h2>Let it be spoken without an effort, without the ghost of a shadow upon it.</h2> <br><br><br><br>
        <h2>Life means all that it ever meant.</h2><br>
        <h3>It is the same as it ever was.</h3><br>
        <h4>There is absolute and unbroken continuity.</h4><br>
        <h5>What is this death but a negligible accident?</h5><br><br><br><br>
        <h5>Why should I be out of mind because I am out of sight?</h5><br>
        <h4>I am but waiting for you, for an interval,</h4><br>
        <h3>somewhere very near,</h3><br>
        <h2>just round the corner.</h2><br><br><br><br>
        <h2>All is well.</h2><br>
        <h3>Nothing is hurt; nothing is lost.</h3><br>
        <h4>One brief moment and all will be as it was before.</h4><br>
        <h5>How we shall laugh at the trouble of parting when we meet again!</h5><br><br><br><br>
