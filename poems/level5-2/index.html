         <p><div class="verse flash">Death</div> is nothing at all.<br>
        It does not count. <br>
        I have only slipped away into the next room. <br>
        Nothing has happened.</p>

        <p>Everything remains exactly as it was. <br>
        I am I, and you are you, <br>
        and the old life that we lived so fondly together is <div class="verse tada">untouched</div>, <div class="verse tada">unchanged.</div> <br>
        Whatever we were to each other, that we are still.</p>

        <p>Call me by the old familiar name. <br>
        Speak of me in the easy way which you always used. <br>
        Put no difference into your tone.<br>
        Wear no forced air of <div class="verse pulse">solemnity</div> or <div class="verse pulse">sorrow</div>.</p>

        <p>Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes that we enjoyed together.
        <div class="verse pulse">Play</div>,<div class="verse pulse">smile</div>,<div class="verse pulse">think</div> of me, <div class="verse pulse">pray</div> for me.
        Let my name be ever the household word that it always was. <br>

        <p>Life means all that it ever meant. <br>
        It is the same as it ever was. <br>
        There is absolute and unbroken continuity. <br>
        What is this <div class="verse flash">death</div> but a negligible accident? </p>

        <p>Why should I be out of mind because I am out of sight? <br>
        I am but waiting for you, for an interval, <br>
        somewhere very <div class="verse tada">near</div>, <br>
        just round the corner.</p>

        <div class="verse pulse">Nothing</div> is hurt; <div class="verse pulse">nothing</div> is lost.<br>
        One brief moment and all will be as it was before. <br>
        How we shall laugh at the trouble of parting when we meet again!<br>
