      <h1>Death Is Nothing At All</h1>
      <h2>by Henry Scott-Holland</h2>

      <p><br><br>
        <strong>Death</strong> is <strong>nothing</strong> at all.
        It does not count.
        I have only slipped away into the next room.
        <strong>Nothing</strong> has happened.
        Everything remains exactly as it was.
        I am I, and you are you,
        and the old life that we lived so fondly together is untouched, unchanged.
        Whatever we were to each other, that we are still.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="container-3">
      <p>Call me by the old familiar name.
        Speak of me in the easy way which you always used.
        Put no difference into your tone.
        Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow.
        Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes that we enjoyed together.
        <span style="font-weight:bolder"><span style="color:#FFF94F;">Play, smile, think of me, pray for me.</span>
        Let my name be ever the household word that it always was.
        Let it be spoken without an effort, without the <strong>ghost</strong> of a shadow upon it. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="container-4">
      <p>Life means all that it ever meant.
        It is the same as it ever was.
        There is absolute and unbroken continuity.
        What is this <strong>death</strong> but a negligible accident?
        Why should I be out of mind because I am out of sight?
        I am but waiting for you, for an interval,
        somewhere very near,
        just round the corner.
        <span style="font-weight:bolder"><span style="color:#FFF94F;">All is well.</span>
        <strong>Nothing</strong> is hurt; nothing is lost.
        One brief moment and all will be as it was before.
        How we shall laugh at the trouble of parting when we meet again!</p>
