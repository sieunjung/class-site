      <p><strong>Death Is Nothing At All </strong><br><br><br>

        <p><strong>Death</strong> is <strong>nothing</strong> at all.<br><br>
        It does not count. <br><br>
        I have only slipped away into the next room. <br><br>
        <strong>Nothing</strong> has happened.</p>

      <p><strong>Everything</strong> remains exactly as it was. <br><br>
        I am I, and you are you, <br><br>
        and the old life that we lived so fondly together is untouched, unchanged. <br><br>
        Whatever we were to each other, that we are still.</p>

      <p>Call me by the old familiar name. <br><br>
        Speak of me in the easy way which you always used. <br><br>
        Put no <strong>difference</strong> into your tone. <br><br>
        Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow.</p>

      <p>Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes that we enjoyed together.<br><br>
        Play, smile, think of me, pray for me. <br><br>
        Let my <strong>name</strong> be ever the household word that it always was. <br><br>
        Let it be spoken without an effort, without the ghost of a shadow upon it.</p>

      <p><strong>Life</strong> means all that it ever meant. <br><br>
        It is the same as it ever was. <br><br>
        There is absolute and unbroken continuity. <br><br>
        What is this <strong>death</strong> but a negligible accident? </p>

      <p>Why should I be out of <strong>mind</strong> because I am out of sight? <br><br>
        I am but waiting for you, for an interval, <br><br>
        somewhere very near, <br><br>
        just round the corner. </p>

        <div class="verse-8">
      <p>All is well. <br>
        <strong>Nothing</strong> is hurt; <strong>nothing</strong> is lost. <br><br>
        One brief moment and all will be as it was before. <br><br>
        How we shall laugh at the trouble of parting when we meet again!</p>
