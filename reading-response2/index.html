      <h1> My Website is a shifting house  </h1>

        <ul>
          <li>There are millions of ways to make a website, and the abundance is daunting.</li>
          <li>On corporation website, user’s happiness is not the primary focus. </li>
          <li>Website is a physical space-“creating a world” with rules. </li>
          <li>“Clarity is one of many possible intentions for a website”</li>
          <li>“A website creator becomes both author and architect simultaneously”</li>
          <li>On the internet no one is looking out for you. </li>
          <li>A Website can be:</li>
          <ol>A room: comforting, flexible feeling</ol>
          <ol>A shelf: nothing too heavy, lighter, simple </ol>
          <ol>A plant: grow on their own, gradually grow, not to be rushed. </ol>
          <ol>A garden: own ways each season, less output and more stirring around on input, life is about balance.</ol>
          <ol>A puddle: appear after rainstorms, temporary collection, evaporates over time.</ol>
          <ol>A thrown rock that’s now falling deep into the ocean: you’ll have to maintain, find a rock and throw it with ideas.</ol>
          <li>“If a website has endless possibilities, and our identities, ideas, and dreams are created and expanded by them, then it’s instrumental that websites progress along with us.”<li>
