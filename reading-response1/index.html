      <p> <strong> A Handmade Web</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J.R Carpenter</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The term 'handmade web' to refer to web pages coded by hand rather than by software. </li>
          <li>“Handmade Web”: web pages and handmade print materials, such as zines, pamphlets, and artists books.</li>
          <li>The physical book when people got to the end they stopped reading. But with web version, the last page linked to the first. “The story circled round  and round.” </li>
          <ol>Print and digital enjoyed a more symbiotic relationship, this is in the early output of trAce Online Writing Centre. </ol>
          <ol>trAce’s first output was a word-processed photocopied booklet, which contained links to websites. </ol>
          <ol>“Whereas archives held in museums or libraries generally contain artifacts created elsewhere….the handmade web pages contained in this online archive continue to exist in the medium within which they were created.” we view them continue to change. </ol>
          <li>The handmade web emerged at a time when print and digital enjoyed a more symbiotic relationship.</li>
          <li>Viewing older version, its similar to temporal paradox, ”layer upon layer of dated web-design aesthetics overlap and peel like wallpaper, revealing earlier versions beneath”</li>
          <li>"Readers have had the option of right-clicking on any page, selecting View Page Source, copying, pasting, and re-writing the source code. In this manner, readers become writers.” </li>
          <li>I notice the handmade webs have great value, and it is an ever-growing platform. Webs or applications became a part of life it does not seem as an internet or device. Like "Millions of Facebook users have no idea they’re using the internet."</li>
